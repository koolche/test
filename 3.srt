1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,270
I'm always in traffic
with the lane expert.

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:08,063
Do you know this type of person?
Constantly re-evaluating...

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,363
their lane choice.
Never quite sure:

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,787
"Is this the best lane for me,
for my life?"

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:17,659
They're always a little bit ahead.
"Can I get in over there?

6
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:19,113
Can I get ahead of you?"

7
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,127
Yeah, come on over here, pal.
We're zooming over here.

8
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,833
This is the secret lane,
nobody knows about it.

9
00:00:25,323 --> 00:00:28,589
The ultimate... I think the ultimate
psychological test of traffic...

10
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:31,381
is the total dead stop.
Not even rolling...

11
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:35,088
and you look out the window,
you see gum clearly.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,468
But we know that in the future,
traffic will get even worse than that.

13
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:42,978
What will happen? Will it start
moving backwards? Is that possible?

14
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:47,940
That someday we'll be going, "Boy,
this is some really bad traffic now.

15
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:51,811
This is really bad.

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,153
I'm gonna try and get off,
and get back on going the other way."

17
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:03,834
- She can't kill me, right?
- No, of course not.

18
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:05,828
- People break up all the time.
- Every day.

19
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:07,912
It just didn't work out.
What can I do?

20
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:10,923
I wanted to love her.
I tried to love her. I couldn't.

21
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,170
You tried.

22
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:16,210
I'd be looking at her face, I'd go,
"Come on. Love her. Love her."

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,511
- Did you tell her you loved her?
- I had no choice.

24
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:21,007
She squeezed it out of me.

25
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:24,600
She'd tell me she loved me. All right,
so at first, I'd just look at her.

26
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,891
I'd go, "Oh, really?"

27
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:31,684
Or, "Boy, that's...
That's something."

28
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,150
But eventually,
you have to come back with:

29
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:37,572
"Well, I love you." You know,
you can only hold out for so long.

30
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,948
- You're a human being.
- I didn't even ask her out.

31
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:42,408
She asked me out first.
She called me up.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,865
What was I supposed to do, say no?
I can't do that to someone.

33
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,244
- You're too nice a guy.
- I am. I'm a nice guy.

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,827
And then she seduced me.

35
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:54,876
We're in my apartment,
I'm on the couch, she's on the chair.

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,208
I get up to go to the bathroom,
I come back...

37
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,714
she's on the couch.

38
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:01,342
What am I supposed to do?
Not do anything?

39
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,139
I couldn't. I would've insulted her.

40
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,641
- You're flesh and blood.
- I had nothing to do with any of this.

41
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:08,850
I met all her friends.

42
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,393
I didn't want to meet them.
I kept trying to avoid it.

43
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,357
I knew it would only
get me in deeper.

44
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:16,443
But they were everywhere. They
kept popping up all over the place.

45
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:20,479
"This is Nancy, Susan, Amy,
my cousin, my brother, my father."

46
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,528
- It's like I'm in quicksand here.
- I told you when I met her.

47
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,991
My back is killing me.

48
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,369
You gotta go to my chiropractor.
He's the best.

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,457
- Everybody's guy is the best.
- I'll make an appointment for you.

50
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,995
- We'll go together.
- Please, they don't do anything.

51
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,789
Do I have to break up with her in
person? Can't I do it over the phone?

52
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,967
- I have no stomach for these things.
- Do it like a Band-Aid.

53
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,963
One motion, right off!

54
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,468
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,640
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting you in.

56
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,931
No, I don't want to sit in back.
I'll be left out of the conversation.

57
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,849
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will, George.

58
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,776
I'll have to stick my chin
on top of the seat.

59
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:01,482
- Okay.
- Why can't you sit in the middle?

60
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:05,106
Please. It doesn't look good.
Boy, boy, girl.

61
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,276
I think you're afraid
to sit next to a man.

62
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:09,990
You're a little homophobic,
aren't you?

63
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:12,286
Is it that obvious?

64
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:14,742
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello.

65
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,325
- Did you get a haircut?
- Nope. Shower.

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,712
So where are we eating?

67
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,798
Tell me if you think this is strange.
There's this guy...

68
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:26,133
who lives in my building who I was
introduced to a couple years ago.

69
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,841
He's a teacher or something.

70
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:32,264
Anyway, after we met, whenever
we'd run into each other in the street...

71
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,012
or in the lobby, or whatever...

72
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:37,519
we would stop and chat a little bit.
Nothing much. Little pleasantries.

73
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,729
He's a nice guy. He's got a family.

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,809
Then after a while,
I noticed there was...

75
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:46,196
no more stopping, just saying hello
and continuing on our way.

76
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,066
And then the verbal hellos stopped...

77
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:52,824
and we just went into these
little sort of nods of recognition.

78
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:56,744
So fine, I figure, that's where this
relationship is finally gonna settle.

79
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,161
Polite nodding.

80
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:00,827
Then one day...

81
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,996
he doesn't nod.

82
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:04,630
Like I don't exist?

83
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:06,838
He went from nods to nothing.

84
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,212
Now there's this intense animosity
whenever we pass.

85
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,390
I mean, it's like we really hate
each other. It's based on nothing.

86
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,350
A relationship is an organism.

87
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,310
You created this thing...

88
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:22,848
and then you starved it,
so it turned against you.

89
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:24,851
Same thing happened in The Blob.

90
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:28,276
I think you absolutely have to say
something to this guy. Confront him.

91
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,477
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:32,691
- Would you do that?
- If I was a different person.

93
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:36,363
Hello?

94
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,494
Hello, is Glen there?

95
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:42,827
I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?

96
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:47,710
Yes, I know I have the wrong number.
I want to know if I dialled wrong or...

97
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:50,880
Why do people do that?

98
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:58,383
Come on up.

99
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,096
Oh, it's you again. See?

100
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,594
If you'd answered me,
I wouldn't have had to do this.

101
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,389
That's two long-distance calls
I've made to you. Why can't you...?

102
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:10,271
Why? Why do they just
hang up like that?

103
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,484
Thank you very much.

104
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,571
- Taste this.
- No, I just had a sandwich.

105
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,736
- No, taste it.
- I don't want cantaloupe now.

106
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:23,582
- You never had it like this before.
- I only eat cantaloupe...

107
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:27,413
- Jerry, this is great cantaloupe.
- All right.

108
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:32,080
- It's very good. It's good.
- It's good, huh?

109
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:35,542
I got it at Joe's, 49 cents a pound.

110
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:38,589
That's practically half than what
you pay at the supermarket.

111
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,471
I don't know why
you don't go to Joe's.

112
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,431
It's too far.

113
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:47,518
It's three blocks further.
You could use my shopping cart.

114
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,271
I'm not pulling a shopping cart.

115
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,983
Am I supposed to wear a kerchief...

116
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,060
put stockings on
rolled below my knee?

117
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,359
The other thing is,
if you don't like anything...

118
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,566
he takes it back.
- I don't return fruit.

119
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:00,986
Fruit's a gamble.

120
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,950
I know that going in.

121
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:14,004
I did it! It's over.

122
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:16,876
- You did it? What happened?
- I told her, in the kitchen.

123
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,383
Which was risky,
because it's near all the knives.

124
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,764
I started with the word "listen."
I said:

125
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:27,432
"Listen, Marlene." The next thing
I know, I'm in the middle of it.

126
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,518
There's this voice inside me going,
"You're doing it."

127
00:06:30,587 --> 00:06:34,021
Then she started to cry,
and I weakened a little bit.

128
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,646
I almost relented, but the voice,
Jerry, the voice said:

129
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,653
"Keep going. Keep going.
You're almost out."

130
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,612
It's like I was making a prison break.

131
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,192
I'm heading for the wall.

132
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:47,280
And I trip and twist my ankle and they
throw that light on you. You know?

133
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:51,952
Somehow I get through the crying
and I keep running.

134
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:53,702
Then the cursing started.

135
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:55,915
She's firing at me
from the guard towers.

136
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,873
"Son of a..." Bang!
"Son of a..." Boom!

137
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:01,373
I get to the top of the wall,
the front door...

138
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,127
I open it up, I'm one foot away.

139
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:06,505
I take one last look around
the penitentiary, and I jump!

140
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,178
See? Never as bad as you imagine.

141
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:10,844
I like that Marlene.

142
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,344
What's her number?

143
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,178
Yeah, no, l... I don't think so.

144
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:20,516
Could you stop that smacking?

145
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,851
George, I want you to taste
this cantaloupe.

146
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,354
- No, thank you.
- It's the best cantaloupe I've had.

147
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,155
- No, really.
- I'll get you a piece.

148
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:30,574
- Jerry, tell him how good it is.
- Very good cantaloupe.

149
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,663
So that's it. You're out.

150
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,080
Except for one small problem.

151
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,004
I left some books in her apartment.

152
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:45,917
So? Go get them.

153
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:49,757
No, I can't go back there.
Jerry, it's so awkward.

154
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,420
It could be dangerous, sexually.
Something could happen.

155
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,220
I'd be right back where I started from.

156
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,184
So forget about the books.

157
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,595
- Did you read them?
- Well, yeah.

158
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:02,229
What do you need them for?

159
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:04,476
I don't know. They're books.

160
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,774
What is this obsession
people have with books?

161
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,401
They put them in their houses
like they're trophies.

162
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,649
What do you need it for
after you read it?

163
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,403
They're my books.

164
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:16,157
So you want me to get the books,
is that it?

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,409
So it must have been 95 degrees
that night...

166
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:26,630
and everyone's standing around the
pool with little drinks in their hands.

167
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,917
I was wearing my old jeans
and T-shirt.

168
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,797
I don't know, I was just
in one of those moods...

169
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:38,344
so I said to myself, "Marlene,
just do it." And I jumped in.

170
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,637
As I'm getting out,
I feel all these eyes on me.

171
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:44,932
So I look up,
and everyone is just staring at me.

172
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,436
So, what did you do?

173
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,445
Well, nothing. It's no skin off my hide
if people like to look.

174
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:53,902
I just didn't see what
the big attraction was.

175
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:57,735
Well, I have a general idea
what it was.

176
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,618
I could take a guess.

177
00:09:00,522 --> 00:09:02,116
Hey, you know, Jerry...

178
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,745
just because George
and I don't see each other...

179
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:07,669
doesn't mean we shouldn't
stay friends.

180
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,666
No.

181
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:14,086
Good enough. I'm really glad
we got that settled.

182
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,506
Great.

183
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:21,343
I don't know how this happened.

184
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,639
Jerry, it's not my fault.

185
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,928
No, it's not your fault.

186
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,061
"Books, books, I need my books."

187
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:33,645
Have you reread those books yet,
by the way?

188
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,394
The great thing, when you read
Moby Dick the second time...

189
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:40,491
Ahab and the whale
become good friends.

190
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:44,986
It's not like Marlene's
a bad person or anything...

191
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:48,165
but, my God, we've had
three lunches and a movie...

192
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,077
and she never stops calling.

193
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,334
And it's those meaningless,
purposeless, blather calls.

194
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:56,664
She never asks if I'm busy
or anything.

195
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:00,673
I just pick up the phone
and she's in the middle of a sentence.

196
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:02,174
It's standard.

197
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:03,841
Has she left you a message...

198
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,553
where she uses up
the whole machine?

199
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:10,854
You know, sometimes
she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?"

200
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:14,355
And I'll go, "Oh, hi, Marlene."

201
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,731
And then it's, "Jerry...

202
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:18,978
I don't know sometimes."
- "Know sometimes."

203
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,777
What about trying
to get off the phone?

204
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:26,282
You can't. It's impossible.

205
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:29,573
There's no break in the conversation
where you can go:

206
00:10:29,648 --> 00:10:31,372
"All right, then."

207
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:35,621
You know, it just goes on and on
without a break in the wall.

208
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,669
I mean, I've gotta put a stop to this.

209
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:41,714
Just do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion. Right off!

210
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:44,880
She is sexy, though.

211
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:48,008
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

212
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,641
Yeah, she is.

213
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:53,303
- Mr. Costanza?
- Yeah?

214
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,187
The doctor will see you now.

215
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:57,432
Yeah. "Doctor."

216
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:05,194
I'm gonna have to wait in that
little room all by myself, aren't I?

217
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,782
I better take this.

218
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:10,027
I hate the little room.

219
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,908
Oh, hello, doctor.

220
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,999
Waiting room. I hate when they
make you wait in the room.

221
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,710
Because it says waiting room.

222
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,538
There's no chance of not waiting...

223
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:25,842
because they call it the waiting
room. They're gonna use it.

224
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,801
It's all set up for you to wait.

225
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,093
You sit there and you got
your little magazine.

226
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:33,265
You pretend you read it, but you're
really looking at other people.

227
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,771
You know, you're thinking
about them. Things like:

228
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,181
"I wonder what he's got."

229
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,437
And, "Soon as she goes,
I'm getting her magazine."

230
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:52,116
Then they finally call you,
and it's a very exciting moment.

231
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,696
They finally call you.

232
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,657
You stand up and kind of look
around at the other people.

233
00:11:56,731 --> 00:12:00,994
"Well, I guess I've been chosen.

234
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:04,202
I'll see you all later."

235
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,546
You think you're gonna see the doctor,
but you're not, are you? No.

236
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:09,756
You're going into
the next waiting room.

237
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,966
The littler waiting room.

238
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:17,303
But if they are doing some
sort of medical thing to you...

239
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:20,725
you want to be in the smallest room
that they have. I think.

240
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:24,513
You don't want to be in
the largest room that they have.

241
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:27,442
You ever see these operating
theatres that they have...

242
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,401
with, like, stadium seating?

243
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,278
You don't want them
doing anything...

244
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:35,112
that makes other doctors go,
"I have to see this.

245
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,822
Are you kidding? Are they
gonna really do that to him?

246
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:40,700
Are there seats? Can we get in?"

247
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,991
Do they scalp tickets
to these things?

248
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,037
"I got two for the Winslow tumour.
I got two."

249
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,509
So how was it?

250
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,762
I was in there for two minutes.
He didn't do anything.

251
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,007
Touch this, feel that. 75 bucks.

252
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,560
Well, it's a first visit.

253
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:05,472
What's 75 bucks?

254
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,390
What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?

255
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:12,316
Am I being entertained?
I don't understand this.

256
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,767
I'm only paying half.

257
00:13:14,972 --> 00:13:16,732
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

258
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,816
He's a doctor.
You gotta pay what he says.

259
00:13:18,892 --> 00:13:21,993
No, no, no. I pay what I say.

260
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:29,536
You feeling weird?

261
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:30,956
No.

262
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:33,038
I'm fine.

263
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:37,215
- Nothing really happened.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:39,295
I know.

265
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,759
We just kissed a little.

266
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,670
People kiss.

267
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,927
Yeah.

268
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:49,227
Well...

269
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,564
Night.

270
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,491
Good night.

271
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,163
- I got it. This time I got it.
- All right.

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,127
Hips. See, it's all in the hips.

274
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,922
Gotta come through
with the hips first.

275
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,257
That is out there.

276
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,261
Definitely.

277
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,678
- Joe's?
- No. Supermarket.

278
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,678
Well, is it good?

279
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:39,522
- It's... It's okay.
- Let me taste that.

280
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,778
See? That stinks.

281
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,988
- You can't eat that. Take that back.
- I'm not taking it back.

282
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,319
- I'll take it back.
- I don't care about it.

283
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:53,450
You should care. Cantaloupe
like this should be out of circulation.

284
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,411
All right. Take it back.

285
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,374
- No.
- Leave a message. I'll call you back.

286
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,801
Jerry, have you ever
taken a bath in the dark?

287
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:11,467
I'm not talking into the soap
right now.

288
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,800
Call me back.

289
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:16,387
Who was that?

290
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,472
- Marlene.
- Mar...

291
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,187
- Marlene.
- Yeah.

292
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,277
I took her home one night.
We started up a little in the car.

293
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,735
- I thought you were getting rid of her.
- I was.

294
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,611
But she's got me, like, hypnotized
or something.

295
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,658
- Does George know?
- No. He'd go nuts.

296
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:34,951
Yeah, no kidding.

297
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,828
I feel terrible.

298
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:45,878
I've seen her a couple
of times since then...

299
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:49,216
and I know I can't go
any further, but...

300
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:53,086
She's got this psychosexual
hold over me. I just want her.

301
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:55,091
I can't breathe. It's like a drug.

302
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,348
Psychosexual.

303
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:03,598
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.

304
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:06,348
Man, I don't understand people.

305
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:09,978
Why would George want
to deprive you of pleasure?

306
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,733
Is it just me?

307
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,232
It's partially you, yeah.

308
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:16,065
You're his friend.

309
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,320
Better that she should sleep
with someone else?

310
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:21,414
Some jerk that he doesn't even know?

311
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,033
- He can't kill me, right?
- You're a human being.

312
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:26,957
She called me. I never called her.
She started it.

313
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,249
- You're flesh and blood.
- I'm a nice guy.

314
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,376
- Hi.
- Hi, Elaine.

315
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,132
My little airplane lamp.

316
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:39,553
You have the slowest elevator
in the entire city.

317
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,477
That's hard to get used to when
you're on so many fast ones.

318
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:45,218
Apartment elevators are always
slower than offices...

319
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,520
because you don't have
to be home on time.

320
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,142
- Unless you're married to a dictator.
- Yeah.

321
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,111
Because they'd be very
demanding people.

322
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,237
Right. Exactly.

323
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,243
I imagine at some point somebody's
gonna offer me some cantaloupe?

324
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,071
No. No good.

325
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,451
Well, you know what they say,
lucky in love, unlucky with fruit.

326
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,331
Well, I'm taking this back.

327
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:18,380
So I had what you might call
a little encounter this morning.

328
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,427
Really? That guy
who stopped saying hello?

329
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,842
- Yes.
- You talk to him?

330
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,807
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail.

331
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,344
At first I was just gonna walk on by
but then I thought, "No, no.

332
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,846
- Do not be afraid of this man."
- Right.

333
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,940
So I walked up behind him, tapped
him on the shoulder and said:

334
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,232
"Hi, remember me?"

335
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,561
And he furrows his brow...

336
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,276
as if he's really trying
to figure it out.

337
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,783
So I said to him...
I said, "You little phoney.

338
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:45,495
You know exactly who I am."

339
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:49,157
- You said, "You little phoney"?
- I did. I most certainly did.

340
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,918
And he goes, "Oh, yeah, you're
Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."

341
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:59,126
I said, "How do you go from that
to totally ignoring a person...

342
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,128
when they walk by?"
- This is amazing.

343
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:06,927
And he says, "Look, I just didn't
want to say hello anymore, all right?"

344
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,800
And I said, "Fine. I didn't want
to say hello anymore either.

345
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:14,893
But I just wanted you to know
that I'm aware of it."

346
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:18,980
You are the queen of confrontation.

347
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,359
You're my new hero.

348
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:25,980
You've inspired me. I'm gonna call
George about something right now.

349
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,414
This cantaloupe stinks.

350
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,122
I don't care.

351
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,621
- You're kidding.
- No, I don't care.

352
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,423
- You mean that?
- Absolutely.

353
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,419
- You don't care?
- No.

354
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:47,346
- How could you not care?
- I don't know, but I don't.

355
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,553
Actually, I'm almost happy to hear it.

356
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:54,386
- I thought you'd be upset.
- I guess I should be, but I'm not.

357
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,977
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?

358
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,389
You're a fine person.
You're a humanitarian.

359
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:00,942
She's very sexy.

360
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,273
- That voice. She's driving me crazy.
- I know. I know.

361
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,274
I can see her tonight
and you don't care?

362
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,569
See her tonight. See her tomorrow.
Go, knock yourself out.

363
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:14,029
- She's too crazy for me.
- All right. As long as you're okay.

364
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,827
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- I'm okay. I'm fine.

365
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,954
I'm wonderful. I never
felt better in my whole life.

366
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,871
Good.

367
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,917
I'll tell you what.

368
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,628
You don't have to pay the $35
I gave the chiropractor...

369
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,461
for the rest of your bill.

370
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,510
You paid that crook?

371
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,052
- I had to.
- He didn't do anything, Jerry.

372
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:36,723
- It's a scam. Who told you to do that?
- It was embarrassing to me.

373
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,768
I was trying to make a point.

374
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,855
Why don't you make a point
with your own doctor?

375
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:44,268
What's wrong?

376
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:47,479
- I think I swallowed a fly.
- Oh, God.

377
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,607
I swallowed a fly!

378
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:51,615
What do I do?

379
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,941
What can happen?

380
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,240
So you want to come up
for a few minutes?

381
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:05,413
I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't
think this is gonna work.

382
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,708
Really?

383
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,589
- I thought...
- I know.

384
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:16,425
I just didn't expect it from the way
you've been acting.

386
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:19,599
Are you sure you want to talk
about this? I sure don't.

387
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,223
Of course I want to talk about it.

388
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:24,223
Well, okay.

389
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,351
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

390
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,859
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?

391
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,401
I saw your act.

392
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,816
My act? What does that
have to do with anything?

393
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,996
Well, to be honest...

394
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:44,322
it just didn't make it for me.

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,204
It's just so much fluff.

396
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,878
I can't believe this.

397
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,798
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

398
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,247
So that's it?

399
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:57,510
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

400
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,260
You're a cashier.

401
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,717
Look, Jerry, it just wasn't
my kind of humour.

402
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,978
You can't go by the audience.
It was late, they were terrible.

403
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,433
I heard the material.

404
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,937
I have other stuff.

405
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,519
You should come see me
on the weekend.

406
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:23,568
Women need to like the job
of the guy they're with.

407
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:26,699
If they don't like the job,
they don't like the guy.

408
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,281
Men know this.

409
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,798
Which is why we make up the phoney,
bogus names for the jobs we have.

410
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:38,214
"Right now, I'm the regional
management supervisor.

411
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:40,591
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

412
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:46,217
Men, on the other hand, if they are
physically attracted to a woman...

413
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,642
are not that concerned
with her job, are we?

414
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:51,092
Men don't really care.

415
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:54,937
Men just go, "Really, slaughterhouse?
That where you work? Interesting.

416
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:58,643
You got a big cleaver, just lopping
their heads off? Sounds great.

417
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,490
Listen, why don't you shower up...

418
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:04,862
and we'll get some burgers
and catch a movie."
